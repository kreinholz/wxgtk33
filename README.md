# wxgtk33 unofficial FreeBSD port

The FreeBSD Ports collection contains wxgtk30 and wxgtk32. However, the current version, wxgtk33, is not yet in Ports.

As of commit 0860959, 23 July 2025, Cemu, the Wii U emulator, uses wxWidgets 3.3.1, i.e. wxgtk33. I created this unofficial port to serve as a dependency for my custom Cemu port.
